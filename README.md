tried to study a research paper which stacks two models using another model and tried to increase its accuracy and impoved the accuracy a little 
the results are as follows

✅ Random Forest Performance:
MSE : 11775876.4346
RMSE: 3431.5997
MAE : 1343.9862
R²  : 0.9769

✅ XGBoost Performance:
MSE : 13274648.2036
RMSE: 3643.4391
MAE : 1984.4220
R²  : 0.9739

✅ Stacked Model (Linear Regression) Performance:
MSE : 10201513.1571
RMSE: 3193.9808
MAE : 1435.3660
R²  : 0.9800



in this project i learnt how stacking of two models works
